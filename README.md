# 🎨 2D to 3D Pixar-Style Image Transformation  
Transforming normal 2D images into 3D Pixar-style characters using Deep Learning & Computer Vision.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project takes a 2D image as input and transforms it into a 3D Pixar-inspired character image.  
The model detects facial features, applies stylization, enhances details, and generates a cartoon-like 3D output.

This project helped me understand key AI concepts like:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Image preprocessing
- Computer Vision pipelines
- Neural style transfer
- Deep learning workflows

## 🧠 Features  
✔ Convert 2D images into 3D Pixar-style outputs  
✔ Facial landmark detection  
✔ Deep learning–based stylization  
✔ Automatic preprocessing (resize, normalization, face cropping)  
✔ Works on any face photo  
✔ Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (as used in notebook)  
- Deep Learning (CNNs)  
- Style Transfer techniques  

---

## 🧪 How It Works  
1. **Load Input Image**  
   - Image is preprocessed (resize, normalize, detect face)

2. **Apply Neural Network**  
   - Style transfer or cartoonification model processes the image  
   - Layers extract features like eyes, nose, face shape
   - Stylization is applied to match Pixar-like characteristics  

3. **Generate Output**  
   - Enhanced 3D-style cartoon image is produced  
   - Saved automatically for preview

## 📸 Example  
### **Input Image:**  
*(Your sample input)*  

### **Output Image:**  
*(Pixar-style output)*  

> You can replace these images with your own examples.

## ▶️ How to Run  
### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udaycharanrada/2d-to-pixar.git
```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook

4. Run the notebook
   
   Open the file:
   2D_to_Pixar_clean.ipynb
   
Run all cells to generate the Pixar-style output

🔥 Future Improvements

1.Add GUI for easier usage
2.Add real-time camera Pixar filter
3.Train a custom stylization model
4.Add support for batch image processing
